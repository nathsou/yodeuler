# Yodeuler

[Yodl](https://github.com/nathsou/yodl) solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.


Yodl is a Hardware Description Language (HDL) meaning that instead of solving the problems with a sequence of instructions which run on a CPU, the solutions are described as dedicated digital circuits which can run on an FPGA to achieve high performance.
